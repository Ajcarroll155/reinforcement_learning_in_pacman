# reinforcement_learning_in_pacman
Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms using UC-Berkeley's Pac-Man simulation template

This was a class project for CS-3600 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) at Georgia Tech. Using the provided template, I implemented algorithms/methods to perform value iteration and q-learning for the purpose of solving markov decision process in a virtual pacman world.
Files in this project with personal code:
    1) valueiterationAgents.py
    2) qlearningAgents.py
    3) analysis.py
All personal code is marked at the start and end points with comments, and can also be found in the project description file "Project 2.htm"
